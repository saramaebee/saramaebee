# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sara! (she/they)

I'm a freelance/hobbyist developer based out of Columbia, South Carolina, USA! I'm also a Cybersecurity major @ UOPX.

I'm also super lucky to be a part of the moderation team for [CodeSupport](https://staging.codesupport.dev/), check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/codesupport)!

As I build some portfolio projects, I'll keep adding them below:

## My Projects

### [Quote Generator App](https://saramaebee-fcc-quotes-app.netlify.app/)
> This was a really fun project, that I completed right after I learned React. I got to learn a lot about the fetch API, and about React obviously!

### [Markdown Previewer](https://saramaebee-fcc-markdown-previewer.netlify.app/)
> Adding on to my React abilities, I decided to make my own markdown viewer using `marked.js`! I put a lot more effort into structuring this project correctly compared to the quote generator, which I'm planning to redo entirely soon.
