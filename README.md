# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sara! (she/they)

I'm a developer based out of Columbia, South Carolina, USA, working in the mortgage industry! I'm also a Cybersecurity major @ UOPX.

I'm also super lucky to be a part of the moderation team for [CodeSupport](https://codesupport.dev/), check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/codesupport)!

As I build some portfolio projects, I'll keep adding them below:

## My Projects

### [Blog/Portfolio Site](https://saratonin.dev)
> This is absolutely a WIP, because it's the project I'm using to learn Ruby on Rails. It might take me a minute, and I can't guarantee that I'm doing everything right, it may even involve some complete rewrites, but I've learned a lot from it!

#### Technologies
- ~~Ruby on Rails
- React
- TypeScript
- Material-UI
- Express
- ~~PostgreSQL

### [Quote Generator App](https://saramaebee-fcc-quotes-app.netlify.app/)
> This was a really fun project, that I completed right after I learned React. I got to learn a lot about the fetch API, and about React obviously!

### [Markdown Previewer](https://saramaebee-fcc-markdown-previewer.netlify.app/)
> Adding on to my React abilities, I decided to make my own markdown viewer using `marked.js`! I put a lot more effort into structuring this project correctly compared to the quote generator, which I'm planning to redo entirely soon.

### [chromium-pickle-ts](https://github.com/saramaebee/chromium-pickle-ts)
> While doing some contracted work that involved the `electron-builder` package source code, I noticed that even though the project was in Typescript, they either _had_ to import [chromium-pickle-ts](https://github.com/electron/node-chromium-pickle-js/) as if it were a JS project, or they didn't feel like writing a declaration file for it (not that I blame them!ðŸ˜›). I figured this would be a fun project, and it was!

## Projects I Contribute(d) to

### [CodeSupport Discord Bot](https://github.com/codesupport/discord-bot)
> This Discord bot uses Discord.js and TypeScript. It is a fantastic addition to the CodeSupport Discord Server.

### [GameMaker Discord Bot](https://christopherwk210.github.io/gm-bot/#/)
> GMBot has tons of really neat features that help the GameMaker Discord server run as smoothly as it does.

### [Asarmor](https://github.com/sleeyax/asarmor/)
> Asarmor is an npm package that allows the blocking of extraction for Electron Asar archives. I did the TypeScript conversion
