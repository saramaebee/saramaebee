# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sara! (she/they)

I'm a freelance/hobbyist developer based out of Columbia, South Carolina, USA! I'm also a Cybersecurity major @ UOPX.

I'm also super lucky to be a part of the moderation team for [CodeSupport](https://staging.codesupport.dev/), check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/codesupport)!

As I build some portfolio projects, I'll keep adding them below:

## My Projects

### [Quote Generator App](https://quotes-app-beta.vercel.app/)
> This was a really fun project, that I completed right after I learned React. I got to learn a lot about the fetch API, and about React obviously!
