# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sara! (they/them)

I'm a developer based out of Columbia, South Carolina, USA! 

I'm also super lucky to be a part of the moderation team for [CodeSupport](https://codesupport.dev/), check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/codesupport)!

As I build some portfolio projects, I'll keep adding them below:

## My Projects

- [SMSpotifY](https://github.com/SMSpotifY/SMSpotifY) (Python, Flask)
  - Before Spotify added this feature natively, I craved a way to let my friends queue songs on my spotify when throwing dinner parties. SMSpotifY was my answer.
- Advent of Code
  - Rust: https://github.com/saramaebee/advent_of_code
  - Haskell: https://github.com/saramaebee/aoc2021hs
- [Quote Generator App](https://quotes.saratonin.dev/)
  - This was a really fun project, that I completed right after I learned React. I got to learn a lot about the fetch API, and about React obviously!
- [Markdown Previewer](https://markdown.saratonin.dev/)
  - Adding on to my React abilities, I decided to make my own markdown viewer using `marked.js`! I put a lot more effort into structuring this project correctly compared to the quote generator, which I'm planning to redo entirely soon.
- [chromium-pickle-ts](https://github.com/saramaebee/chromium-pickle-ts)
  - While doing some contracted work that involved the `electron-builder` package source code, I noticed that even though the project was in Typescript, they either _had_ to import [chromium-pickle-ts](https://github.com/electron/node-chromium-pickle-js/) as if it were a JS project, or they didn't feel like writing a declaration file for it (not that I blame them!ðŸ˜›). I figured this would be a fun project, and it was!

## Projects I Contribute(d) to

- [CodeSupport Discord Bot](https://github.com/codesupport/discord-bot)
  - This Discord bot uses Discord.js and TypeScript. It is a fantastic addition to the CodeSupport Discord Server.
- [GameMaker Discord Bot](https://christopherwk210.github.io/gm-bot/#/)
  - GMBot has tons of really neat features that help the GameMaker Discord server run as smoothly as it does.
- [Asarmor](https://github.com/sleeyax/asarmor/)
  - Asarmor is an npm package that allows the blocking of extraction for Electron Asar archives. I did the TypeScript conversion

## Living list of [Things I don't Know](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/)

I think this is a good way for me to understand what I don't know better, or rather what I need to target my learning on. It isn't a complete list. The header isn't necessarily something I don't know, but rather a category. Note to Sara: Check Zotero for resources, you've probably saved some relevant ones in your Unfiled Items :) 

### Web Dev
- CORS (I run into the errors and I can usually fix them with a quick google to remind myself, but I could do better)
- Sockets (I _think_ they aren't necessarily exclusive to webdev, but that's the context in which I've typically encountered them
- Reactive programming/rxjs

#### React 
- Hooks/effects
- Component lifecycle

### Languages

#### Rust
- I'd love to get into writing some embedded software in Rust

#### Swift
- Just this

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Generator functions
- Intricacies/fine print of prototypal inheritance and its implementation in JS

### Development Theory

#### Algorithms
- I have decent problem solving skills, but there are numerous CS algorithms that have useful applications, many of which I'm sure I could have used at some point in the past. I'd love to get a [black-boxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDzsrmMl48I) understanding of them

#### Containerization
- Need to learn more about topic in general, rather the application of it than the theory.
- Kubernetes
- Docker

#### Algebraic Effects
- fused-effects

### General Nerd Stuff

#### Linux
- `bash`
  - I can navigate the terminal just fine and am more than capable of working in a CLI-only environment, but any scripting I do relies on Python typically. I'd like to become more proficient in bash just to make my life easier
- Arch
  - I did ok using debian, and managed to do most stuff fine, but I would very much like to run through setting up Arch and using it for a bit eventually. I want to have a better understanding of a lot of the stuff debian made easier for me.
