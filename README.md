# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sara! (they/them)

I'm a developer based out of Columbia, South Carolina, USA! 

I'm also super lucky to be a part of the moderation team for [CodeSupport](https://codesupport.dev/), check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/codesupport)!

As I build some portfolio projects, I'll keep adding them below:

## Living list of [Things I don't Know](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/)

I think this is a good way for me to understand what I don't know better, or rather what I need to target my learning on. It isn't a complete list. The header isn't necessarily something I don't know, but rather a category. Note to Sara: Check Zotero for resources, you've probably saved some relevant ones in your Unfiled Items :) 

### Web Dev
- CORS (I run into the errors and I can usually fix them with a quick google to remind myself, but I could do better)
- Sockets (I _think_ they aren't necessarily exclusive to webdev, but that's the context in which I've typically encountered them
- Reactive programming/rxjs

#### React 
- Hooks/effects
- Component lifecycle

### Languages

#### Rust
- I'd love to get into writing some embedded software in Rust

#### Swift
- Just this

#### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Generator functions
- Intricacies/fine print of prototypal inheritance and its implementation in JS

### Development Theory

#### Algorithms
- I have decent problem solving skills, but there are numerous CS algorithms that have useful applications, many of which I'm sure I could have used at some point in the past. I'd love to get a [black-boxed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDzsrmMl48I) understanding of them

#### Containerization
- Need to learn more about topic in general, rather the application of it than the theory.
- Kubernetes
- Docker

#### Algebraic Effects
- fused-effects

### General Nerd Stuff

#### Linux
- `bash`
  - I can navigate the terminal just fine and am more than capable of working in a CLI-only environment, but any scripting I do relies on Python typically. I'd like to become more proficient in bash just to make my life easier
- Arch
  - I did ok using debian, and managed to do most stuff fine, but I would very much like to run through setting up Arch and using it for a bit eventually. I want to have a better understanding of a lot of the stuff debian made easier for me.
